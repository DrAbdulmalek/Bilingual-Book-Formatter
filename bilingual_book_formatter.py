# Placeholder for bilingual_book_formatter.py
# This is a simplified version. The actual file should include:
# - Document parsing (DOCX, PDF, Markdown)
# - Content alignment with multiprocessing
# - Image processing (WEBP conversion, duplicate detection)
# - EPUB, PDF, DOCX output generation
# - Google Drive and DeepL integration
# - Advanced GUI with PyQt6
